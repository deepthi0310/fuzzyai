Project Title: Fuzzy Logic-Based Chemical Dosage Prediction System

Description:
This project implements a fuzzy logic model to intelligently predict the optimal chemical dosage required for water treatment processes based on varying input parameters such as pH level, turbidity, and flow rate. Unlike traditional threshold-based systems, this approach leverages fuzzy inference rules to handle uncertainty and imprecision in real-world scenarios. The system enhances operational efficiency and ensures precise dosage control, thereby minimizing chemical waste and improving water quality.

Technologies Used:

Fuzzy Logic Toolbox / Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)

MATLAB / Python (scikit-fuzzy)

Data preprocessing & visualization

Rule-based inference mechanism

Objective:
To develop a decision-support tool that aids process engineers in determining accurate chemical dosages using fuzzy rule sets, improving safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability in water treatment facilities.
